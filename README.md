# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Comprehensive React Learning Plan

## 1. JavaScript Fundamentals
**Goal:** Establish a strong foundation in JavaScript before diving into React.
**Why it's important:** React is built on JavaScript, and a solid understanding of JS will make learning React much easier.

**Key topics to cover:**
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, modules, etc.)
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Object-oriented programming in JavaScript

**Real-world example:** Building a todo list application using vanilla JavaScript.

## 2. React Basics
**Goal:** Understand the core concepts of React and how to create simple applications.
**Why it's important:** These fundamentals form the basis for all React development.

**Key topics to cover:**
- JSX syntax
- Components (functional and class-based)
- Props and state
- Handling events
- Conditional rendering

**Real-world example:** Converting the vanilla JS todo list into a React application.

## 3. Component Lifecycle and Hooks
**Goal:** Learn how to manage component lifecycle and state in functional components.
**Why it's important:** Hooks are the modern way to handle state and side effects in React applications.

**Key topics to cover:**
- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- Custom hooks

**Real-world example:** Adding data persistence to the todo list using localStorage and useEffect.

## 4. Styling in React
**Goal:** Explore different approaches to styling React components.
**Why it's important:** Proper styling techniques help create maintainable and scalable UI components.

**Key topics to cover:**
- CSS modules
- Styled-components
- CSS-in-JS libraries
- Tailwind CSS

**Real-world example:** Applying a consistent design system to the todo list application.

## 5. State Management
**Goal:** Learn how to manage application state effectively in larger React applications.
**Why it's important:** As applications grow, managing state becomes more complex and requires specialized solutions.

**Key topics to cover:**
- React Context API
- Redux
- MobX
- Recoil

**Real-world example:** Implementing user authentication and theme switching in the todo list app.

## 6. Routing
**Goal:** Understand how to create multi-page applications in React.
**Why it's important:** Routing is essential for building full-fledged web applications with multiple views.

**Key topics to cover:**
- React Router
- Navigation and history
- Route parameters
- Nested routes

**Real-world example:** Adding multiple views to the todo list (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, task details).

## 7. Forms and User Input
**Goal:** Learn how to handle form submissions and user input effectively in React.
**Why it's important:** Forms are a crucial part of most web applications for gathering user data.

**Key topics to cover:**
- Controlled components
- Form validation
- React Hook Form
- Formik

**Real-world example:** Creating a user registration form for the todo list application.

## 8. API Integration
**Goal:** Understand how to interact with backend services from React applications.
**Why it's important:** Most real-world applications require data from a server or third-party APIs.
